# Horiseon_Code_Refractor

Description/Usage:
This is the first Homework assignment for the UT Coding bootcamp. The goal is to refractor a working web page into a Semantic format while keeping the essential functionality of the website. There were some corrections that needed to be made to get the links functioning in the HTML.

The CSS was also condensed into a semantic format and comments were added to clean up the code.
